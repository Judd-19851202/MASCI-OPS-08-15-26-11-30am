## Severity Definitions (locked)

- **CRITICAL**: production reads preview DB · preview reads production DB · auth broken · core portal broken · role boundary broken · production shows test/demo/preview data · production write path broken · public gate broken · backup/restore unsafe · major route 500s · route linked from UI dead and blocks operations · secrets exposed · startup guard missing/failing.
- **MAJOR**: important workflow partially broken · key card/stats misleading · route visible but not functional · mobile/iPad blocks field use · integration status inaccurate · production data questionable · navigation dead-end in active module.
- **MINOR**: typo · cosmetic spacing · non-blocking warning · optional route not linked · intentional stub clearly labeled.

## TRACK 0 — Certification Control & Evidence Ledger

- **Date/Time**: 2026-02-11
- **Agent session**: e1 fork (post Sprint #9)
- **Preview source hash**: `2082f9fcfa0e9393aaf0e77f27e01bab`
- **Preview last started**: `2026-06-11T15:26:01.985569+00:00`
- **Production source hash**: `1ad558b08185a5519365f46dbbd9dfef`
- **Production last started**: `2026-06-11T15:07:27.493020+00:00`
- **Hash delta**: PREVIEW differs from PRODUCTION (carries Sprint 5-9 Live Map decision-surface work)
- **Verdict**: ✅ **PASS**

### 1. Scope executed
- Created append-only ledger at `/app/memory/MASCI_RC_CERTIFICATION_LEDGER.md`
- Captured live preview + production source hashes via `/api/version`
- Locked program charter (env constraints, deployment gate)
- Locked severity definitions
- Locked per-track output schema
- Locked track list (Tracks 0-12)

### 2. Evidence collected
- Preview source hash recorded: `2082f9fcfa0e9393aaf0e77f27e01bab`
- Production source hash recorded: `1ad558b08185a5519365f46dbbd9dfef`
- Preview backend last started: 2026-06-11T15:26 UTC
- Production backend last started: 2026-06-11T15:07 UTC
- Both `/api/version` endpoints returned 200

### 3. Routes tested
- `GET /api/version` on PREVIEW (200)
- `GET /api/version` on PRODUCTION (200)

### 4. UI/screens tested
- None (TRACK 0 is control-plane only)

### 5. Data checked
- None (TRACK 0 is control-plane only)

### 6. Workflow actions executed
- None (TRACK 0 is control-plane only)

### 7. Findings by severity
- **Critical**: 0
- **Major**: 0
- **Minor**: 0

### 8. Fixes performed
- None

### 9. Retest results after fixes
- N/A

### 10. Remaining items
- Tracks 1-12 remain to be executed in dedicated agent sessions, one (or a small group) per session.
- Recommendation: execute Track 1 (Foundation / Environment / Isolation / Startup Guards) next, in its own session.

### 11. Certification decision
- **TRACK 0**: ✅ PASS
- Ledger is established. Hashes are locked. Subsequent tracks must append below this entry. Do not modify or delete this section.
